            The owner was unsure if the shop was truly profitable after all expenses. We worked
            through his records, separated personal drawings from business costs, and set up a
            simple monthly view. Restocking and staffing decisions became less stressful and more
            grounded.

            conversations improved and the owner gained more time for clients and partnerships.

            monthly review sheet. The aim was reliability and consistency, without new complex
            systems.
